## 🚀 Terminal Commands Available

## 💡 Why Tunnel Mode?

Tunnel mode works **on ANY network** - your iPhone and Mac don't need to be on the same WiFi!
The connection goes through Expo's cloud servers, so it works even if:
- Your Mac is on WiFi and iPhone on mobile data
- You're on different networks
- You have firewall restrictions

**Note:** Tunnel mode is slightly slower than LAN mode, but much more reliable for connectivity issues.
