# Warnings and Errors Cleanup Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ 1. Profile Fetch 406 Error (PGRST116)

**Problem:**
```
[Error] Error fetching profile: {code: "PGRST116", details: "The result contains 0 rows"...}
```

**Solution:**
Updated `lib/profile.ts` to handle PGRST116 error silently since it's expected for new users:

```typescript
if (error.code === "PGRST116") {
  return null; // Profile doesn't exist yet, this is expected
}
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ No more error logs when profile doesn't exist

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Route Warnings for Non-Route Files

**Problems:**
```
[Warning] Route "./MonthDropdown.tsx" is missing the required default export
[Warning] Route "./budget.tsx" is missing the required default export  
[Warning] Route "./lib/finnhub.ts" is missing the required default export
```

**Solution:**
Moved files out of `app` directory (Expo Router treats all files in `app` as routes):

1. ‚úÖ `app/MonthDropdown.tsx` ‚Üí `components/MonthDropdown.tsx`
2. ‚úÖ `app/budget.tsx` ‚Üí Deleted (was empty)
3. ‚úÖ `app/lib/finnhub.ts` ‚Üí `lib/finnhub-app.ts`
4. ‚úÖ Removed empty `app/lib` directory

**Result:** ‚úÖ No more route warnings for non-route files

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è 3. Shadow and PointerEvents Warnings

**Warnings:**
```
[Warning] "shadow*" style props are deprecated. Use "boxShadow".
[Warning] props.pointerEvents is deprecated. Use style.pointerEvents
```

**Analysis:**
These warnings come from React Native Web's internal handling:

- **shadow* props**: These are the correct React Native way to handle shadows cross-platform (iOS, Android, Web). React Native Web converts them to CSS boxShadow on web. The warning is informational only.

- **pointerEvents**: Not found in our code - likely from internal React Native Web components.

**Decision:** ‚úÖ No action needed - these are framework-level warnings that don't affect functionality. Using React Native's shadow* props is the correct cross-platform approach.

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Registration Flow
- User registers ‚Üí Email confirmation required
- Profile is deferred until first login (RLS compliant)
- Full name stored in metadata
- Console logs: üîµ for info, ‚úÖ for success, ‚ùå for errors

### ‚úÖ Login Flow  
- User logs in after email confirmation
- Profile fetched from database (no error if doesn't exist)
- Profile created with name from metadata
- User redirected to app

### ‚úÖ Error Handling
- PGRST116 (no profile) handled silently
- Duplicate user detection added
- Clear error messages for users

---

## Files Modified

1. `lib/profile.ts` - Silent handling of PGRST116 error
2. `components/MonthDropdown.tsx` - Moved from app directory
3. `lib/finnhub-app.ts` - Moved from app/lib directory
4. `app/budget.tsx` - Deleted (empty file)

---

## Remaining Warnings (Can Ignore)

These are React Native Web framework warnings and don't need fixing:

### "shadow*" style props warning
- **Why**: React Native Web informing that it's converting shadow props to CSS
- **Impact**: None - shadows work correctly
- **Action**: Ignore - shadow* is the correct React Native API

### pointerEvents warning  
- **Why**: Internal React Native Web component usage
- **Impact**: None - interactions work correctly
- **Action**: Ignore - not in our code

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Register new user ‚Üí No route warnings
- [x] Confirm email ‚Üí Works
- [x] Login ‚Üí No 406/PGRST116 errors
- [x] Profile created ‚Üí Appears in database
- [x] Console clean ‚Üí Only informational framework warnings

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed:**
- Profile fetch errors silenced (expected behavior)
- Route warnings eliminated
- Files properly organized

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Informational Warnings (Safe to Ignore):**
- Shadow props (React Native Web)
- Pointer events (React Native Web)

üéâ **Result:** Clean, functional authentication flow with minimal warnings!
